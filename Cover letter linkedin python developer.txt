Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited about the Python/Backend Developer role at your company. With 3.5+ years in Backend Development, I've excelled in leading projects and achieving significant results.

As Edupherz Pvt. Ltd's Backend Developer, I spearheaded the development of the Fernglasz website in Spring Boot and Kotlin. I optimized RESTful APIs, reduced response times by 30%, and maintained clean codebases through Spring Security integration and diligent code reviews.

At Deloitte Consulting India Pvt. Ltd (Mar 2021 - May 2023), I played a pivotal role as a Python Developer (DC-Analyst), ensuring a seamless migration of transactional records and resolving over 50 defects. I managed releases and data loads in QA and UAT Environments.

In my previous role at Kloudone Technology Works Pvt. Ltd (Oct 2020 - Mar 2021), I developed applications in Python Django, Rest API, and MySQL, addressing performance issues and enhancing reporting speed by 24%.

Committed to continuous learning, I hold certifications in Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Django Python Development, Red Hat Certified System Administrator, and Microsoft Technology Associate.

Among my achievements are the "Team Spot Award" at Deloitte in 2023, "Outstanding Performer of the Year" in 2022, and a Global Rank-2932 in Google Hash code 2019. I also won the Janagni-2K18 Coding Competition at GKV University in 2018.

Confident in my technical expertise and positive attitude, I am eager to contribute to your team's success as a Python/Backend Developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience aligns with your needs.

Sincerely,
Hari Mohan Meena
